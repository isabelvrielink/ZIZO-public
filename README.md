# ZIZÓ: Public

Welcome to the public repository of ZIZÓ, a personal project developed as part of my continuous learning and passion for cooking, hosting, and artificial intelligence. ZIZÓ is envisioned as a sophisticated food application and AI-powered assistant aimed at enhancing the experience of hosting and meal planning for hobby chefs and culinary enthusiasts.

Project Scope and Objectives

ZIZÓ provides a comprehensive platform for:
•	Recipe Sharing: Enabling users to discover and share unique recipes within a community. 
•	Event Planning: Offering tools to plan and organize dinner events, create tailored menus, and generate shopping lists.
•	AI-Driven Insights: Leveraging artificial intelligence for personalized recommendations for inspiration, quick assembly of events and smart computation.

My Role and Contributions

This project serves as a showcase of my technical expertise and problem-solving skills. All aspects of ZIZÓ, including its design, architecture, and development, are being independently executed by me. Key areas of focus include:

•	Frontend Development: Implementing intuitive and responsive user interfaces using React Native.
•	Backend Systems: Architecting scalable services with Node.js, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL.
•	Artificial Intelligence Integration: Developing intelligent recommendation systems to enhance user experience with Python.
